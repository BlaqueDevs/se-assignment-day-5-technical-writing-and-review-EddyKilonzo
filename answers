* **Improved User Experience:** When users can easily understand instructions and information, they have a more positive experience with the product or service.

**6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?**

Here are some examples of simplifying technical terms:

| Technical Term | Simpler Alternative | Why it Improves Comprehension for a Non-Technical Audience |
|---|---|---|
| Initiate | Start, Begin | "Start" and "Begin" are common, everyday words with a clear meaning. "Initiate" is more formal and less immediately understandable. |
| Execute | Run, Perform | "Run" and "Perform" are more intuitive actions than "execute," which can sound more abstract. |
| Configure | Set up, Adjust | "Set up" and "Adjust" clearly convey the action of making changes to settings. "Configure" is a technical term that requires prior understanding. |
| Implement | Put in place, Use, Add | These alternatives describe the action in a more concrete way than the abstract "implement." |
| Parameter | Setting, Option, Value | These words are more descriptive of what a "parameter" actually represents. |
| Repository | Storage, Place to find files | These alternatives clearly explain what a "repository" is for someone unfamiliar with version control systems. |
| Deprecated | No longer supported, Old, Will be removed | These phrases directly communicate the status of the feature without requiring knowledge of the technical term "deprecated." |
| Instantiate | Create, Make | "Create" and "Make" are simple and direct verbs. "Instantiate" is a programming term. |
| Query | Ask, Search for | These alternatives clearly explain the action of retrieving information. |

By using simpler, more common words, you remove a barrier to understanding for non-technical audiences, allowing them to focus on the core information rather than getting bogged down in unfamiliar terminology.
